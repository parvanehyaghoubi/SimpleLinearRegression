# Linear Regression Project

In this project, the optimal value of slope and intercept  is calculated in a simple linear equation by a Python function. 
In this function, the input values ​​are two arrays that replace them in the formula. Finally, it computes the optimal value of the slope and the intercept.

This function calculates `slope` and `intercept` using the following formulas: 

- `θ (slope) = Σ (x' * y') / Σ (x' ** 2)`

- `c (intercept) = ȳ - θx̄`
